## Usage

Requires Python 3.11

There is one file for each day (`day_01.py`, `day_02.py`, etc...) with its corresponding unit test (`test_day_01.py`, `test_day_02.py`, etc...).

To run the project, execute its unit tests using `python3 -m unittest` from the repo root.

The project has no dependencies except for development tools like [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) and [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black).  
I manage my virtual env with [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), if you have Pipenv installed just run `pipenv install` from the repo root to get the tools.
